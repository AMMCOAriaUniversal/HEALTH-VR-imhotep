To Do
===========================================================================

- Text input method in VR. Currently, text input is done via keyboard. We are working on this.
- Loading indicator while loading volume data
- Volumetric rendering of Saggital and Coronal volumes (i.e. volumes where the saved slices are oriented in non-transverse direction). These are currently disabled because they would be rendered using a wrong orientation.
- Re-add automatic label positioning.
- Queue for loading multiple DICOMs consequently? When a DICOM volume is being loaded, the loading of DICOM 2D slices is currently blocked.
